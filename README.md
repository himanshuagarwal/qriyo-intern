Build an interface to search and browse through the attached movie database. At a minimum, the interface is expected to allow the user to search for movies by  Keywords (should search the title, plot, and director columns in one search) Genre (pick from a list of possible genres, show all movies in that genre) You are at liberty to determine what elements from the database should be displayed on the individual movie pages. At least show the poster, title, genre and director.
